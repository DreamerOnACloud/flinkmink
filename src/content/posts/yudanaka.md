It started with "the boss of them all, since 1992" - a famous brand coffee from one of the myriad vending machines. Not hot, but just right, not bitter, but just strong enough - a true boss â˜•

Caffeinated and awake, we're now sitting on the platform, waiting on our bullet train to spirit us away unto the mountains.

Train ride was fast and with a pretty view of nature. We were amazed to see mountains, mist, forests in varying colors, the Japanese alps with snowy tops.
Near our destination we witnessed a magnificent rainbow hovering above the mountain range and farmers fields.
In Yudanaka we just missed the bus, so we walked the 20 minutes to the onsen (a sort of traditional bathhouse hotel) Was pretty cold from the fresh mountain air.
We quickly dropped the luggage at the hotel and took the bus to the monkey park. Then another 1.5 km walk up to the park via the dense forest. Some light rain fell on us, then stopped. During the walk, we were curious if we would be lucky enough to witness the monkeys, as they only descend to the nstural thermal baths of the park if it's cold.
Once at the snow monkey park, and to our amazement and delight, we spotted monkeys even before entering. They we all around, and not shy at all (but luckily also not aggressive towards us); as if we didn't exist. They would walk right by us sometimes.
It was adorable to see them bathing in the hot water, drinking and cleaning each other. Sometimes they would also fight though.

After we took unlimited photos, we finally left the park, in bliss.

Back at the onsen, the experience exceeded our expectations. The personnel welcomed us warmly, showed us to our room, served us tea and dressed us up in traditional "yukata". We felt Japanese for a second. We also wore traditional slippers.
Then, we had dinner. Can't remember how many dishes, but more than 10. Yummy Japanese food, prepared with attention to detail. The lady was serving and serving, felt like a multicourse dinner. 

Then, time for the public onsen..
There were 2 in the hotel, 1 for women, 1 for men, then once a day they would swap so men & women could visit both. Smart.

We went separately, of course, but almost had the same experience. We came upon only one other (Japanese) person, briefly, and for the rest it was empty. All to ourselves ðŸ›€ Hot, relaxing, zen. Faye had a stone outdoors onsen, and on the side they put a metal lantern owl as decorum.
She kept looking at it, meditating.
Kostas had a stone shrine instead, rest was the same.

We liked it so much that we wanted to experience it together, so we also booked a private onsen. After so much relaxation, time for a good night's sleep, on a futon bed and in our nice "yukata" for the first time.
