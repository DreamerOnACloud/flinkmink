Went to the tori gates (fushimi inari-taisha) early in the morning. It was already crazy busy and a bit claustrophobic while walking through the gates. The row of gates was endless, so much longer than we thought. Which was also pretty impressive, if it weren't for the crowds, as we had to walk very slowly in a huge row. 
Next, we went to kiyomizu-dera, a temple on a hill with 3 water streams for health, knowledge and love. It is located on a hill and has a good view of the city. We also saw eagles and hawks soaring in the sky above it. Very crowded as well. Lots of nature around it, and hills. Many autumn foliage colors.
We witnessed a peculiar tree-pruning competition. Men gathered around a bonsai, passionately pruning it in front of what seemed to us like judges, sitting in chairs, taking their jobs very seriously, watching with utmost attention.

Time for lunch, our bellies were protesting after all the walking. Discovered a small local place in the vicinity: usagi no ippo. Traditional place, had to take off our shoes. Had the best lunch so far in Kyoto there. With new energy, we headed out to explore once more.

Next stop: eikan-do-zenrin-ji. A temple with fabulous gardens full of Japanese maple trees. The most impressive autumn foliage so far within a temple, with yellow, orange, red maple leaves. Cute bridges over streams, ponds and lakes filled with colorful cod fish.

Then we walked the philosopher's path, seeing some temples along the way. It was a more quiet place with picturesque little houses.

Next, some japanese tea and sweets at a famous teahouse: toraya kary≈ç.
The matcha tea we ordered was bitter, so the sweet on the side is served to temper the bitterness of the tea. It was a good combination.

Tomorrow we leave Kyoto.
In conclusion, Kyoto was overwhelming with the myriads of beautiful temples and big crowds. However, we still managed, because we were selective with where to go. And that's mainly  thanks to Alice's recommendations & the dutch couple (we met at the Nakasendo trail) suggesting eikan temple.
