Kyoto day 1.
We started early to make it to the golden temple (kinkaku-ji) before the crowd. Took a bus, as the distances are still huge im Kyoto. Was already super crowded, but we understand why it's super touristic. It's a really shiny golden temple, surrounded by beautiful gardens and hilltops.

Afterwards, we sent to Ryoan-ji, with the famous zen garden and a magnificent Japanese garden with a big lake. Our first minimalistic zen garden. A bit too minimalistic, we found. Why pebbles? But we liked ths rocks, surrounded by moss. The "real" garden there, was the most beautiful we have seen so far. 

Then, time to stop for lunch. Gontaro is the place, gotta take off shoes and sit on floor. Food was value for money, with yummy big deep-fried shrimps and heartwarming soup.

Went to the nijo castle, huge complex and a historical place where the shogun gave the power back to the emperor.

Then, a stop for sweets. Had the strangest ice-cream ever: weird jelly balls, macha, weird fruit, chestnut cream and crunchy corn flakes.

Saw a few more temples and then headed for the geisha district, Gion. We got very disappointed. We expected many alleys with traditional houses and geishas walking around. But in real life there were no geishas and only a few small alleys with big crowds. We had different expectations as we had seen the Japanese Netflix series "the Makanai". Finally got out of the crowd and headed back for the hotel. We briefly stopped at a temple at night before returning.
