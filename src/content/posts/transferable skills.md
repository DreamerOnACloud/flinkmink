If you are considering a professional role transition from web developer to UX/UI designer, here's a list of relevant, transferable skills. 

You can spot a lot of transferable skills, which you may already have, and which can be immediately transferred to your new role as UX/UI designer and be used as an argument on why you are a good fit for the job.

Here’s a list of transferable skills I have identified:

1. **Front end design**: this is a clear overlap between a UI designer an a web developer. they both focus on the visual interface of a website.
2. **Web design**: understanding the medium, the web, how sites render in browsers, CSS layouts
3. **Ideating**: with the device in mind, asking the question “where will the design be displayed”?
4. **Creating human-centered solutions**: in the form of a digital app specifically (here lies the overlap)
5. Starting with clear **definitions** and a high-level “shape” of the project
6. **Attention to detail** (e.g. “pixel perfect”)
7. **Design system**: defining & using a color palette (the typical convention is HEX, eg. #2E95AD)
8. **Page stacks**: understanding the concept of reusable visual template(s)
9. **More precise, less ambiguous**: in UX, with good questions; in coding, with clean code and annotations.
10. **Peer reviews**: in both professions, peer reviews are a core part of the daily job and help develop one’s skillset:
    - communication
    - constructive feedback
    - clear understanding
    - presentation & articulation of ideas and thoughts
    - collaboration
11. **Thinking about the UI** (interaction design / user flows / interactive components)
12. **UI elements**, especially components
13. **Consistency** in structure, layout (CSS grids, flexbox, Figma auto-layout) and styling (UI components)
14. **Functional structure**: where will elements, such as title, calendar, events and nav bar be positioned on the screen and how much space will they occupy?
15. **Design Patterns/UI library**: The primary reason for creating a pattern library would be to ensure the UI stays consistent (design system)
16. **State management and state change**, this is reflected both in design (e.g. Figma component variants) and in code (CSS selectors, HTML attributes).
17. Creating a database of good (UX /UI/ code snippets) **resources** for future reference.
18. **Online presence**: following inspiring people in the field, and interacting
19. **Continuous learning & practice**: learning from the “best”, by finding mentors & educators.
20. **Accessibility**: Thinking about all users / include as many as possible
