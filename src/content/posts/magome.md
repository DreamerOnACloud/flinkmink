We took the morning bus to the nakasendo train, starting in Magome. Luckily there's a  service that drops off your baggage at the destination (Tsumago for us).

Dropped off the luggage and started our hike in Magome, a picturesque village up the hill with a lot of water mills and modern caf√©s snd well taken care of home gardens.

Magome and Tsumago are famous post towns of the past, and the trail is a legendary samurai one, that connected Tokyo with Kyoto during the Edo period.

We dropped odd our big luggage and started the hike immediately, as it takes at least 2 hours. There are big bells along the  trail, roughly every kilometer, to ward off bears. We ran every bell just for fun, it's a nicr tradition, and kept us safe from the bears, you never know üêª

We took our sweet time, stopping a lot for taking in the view or making photos. We saw dense forests, autumn foliage, a lot of moss, a few Buddhist statues, waterfalls, flowers and bamboo forests.

Along the way, the was a free tea house. An old man opened up his home to serve tea to all the hikers coming along this path. We definitely wanted to witness their traditional Japanese tea experienced. So we sat down and took our time to drink tea.

As we almost reached the end of the trail, ww noticed a beautiful red orange maple tree. That's when Faye spotted a Dutch couple. We talked and shared some experiences & tips of japan.
Bottom line: we love Japan and will definitely come back. Also funny: dutch couple said, everywhere they went, they made lists of things for every little thing they wanna do (next time), but they said that we should try to live more in the moment to enjoy it more.

Satisfied, we reached Tsumago-juku and waited a bit in the sun outside the train station, finishing up on the yummy apples.
Took the shinkan-sen to Kyoto.
