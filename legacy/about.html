                <p>
                    Since I was a kid, I’ve been fascinated by transformers, legos, and computers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’ve spent countless hours building, designing, and rearranging physical stuff as well as designing, coding, testing, and playing with digital content such as mobile apps, websites, and video games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What excites me is new tech, a good story, aesthetic & intuitive design, and creating stuff that starts off as a simple idea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The digital space is the perfect playground for my interests and aptitudes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have spent multiple professional years coding mobile and web apps, and design won me over once I hopped on a design system project, where I’ve had the opportunity to work with multiple disciplines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 2 sides of the design system coin - design & code - intrigued me and I jumped on the chance to explore the full spectrum of product development, from ideation, to design, to code and testing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m either fiddling with designs on Figma, coding some of those designs to bring them to life, or writing about my latest explorations on Twitter & Medium.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently focused on UX & UI Design, so I can be found reading, writing, and working on that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But healthy mind in healthy body, so I can also be found camping and hiking somewhere in Europe’s hilly sides. I’ve found there’s nothing like getting in touch with nature, a breath of fresh air and a good view for reinvigorating the spirit.
