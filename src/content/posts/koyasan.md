Woke up in Kyoto.
Had a quick breakfast, then checked out.
Onwards to Koyasan today, where we'll be staying at a monastery with monks.
There's a lot of train switches to make it there, so we will take it easy. Or so we thought. Faye has a bit of a cold and was feeling tired. It got worse when she got overwhelmed by the crowd in the train. Especially in Osaka station.
1 metro, 2 trains, 1 ropeway & 1 bus. Finally, arrived at Koyasan. It's midday, cold wind and  blue sunny sky. Only hills in forest here. And a lot of temples. Besides these, Koyasan consists of just a couple convenience stores, a dozen souvenir stores, and little else.
A quick check in at the monastery, where a friendly monk let us drop off our luggage, then off to the main sight of the area: okunoin cemetery, sacred home of the mausoleum of Kobo Daishi, founder of Shingon Buddhism. Koyasan is said to be where Buddhism in Japan was born.
The area was impressive, with huge Cedar trees all over, thick as elephants and 30 meters high.
Stone monuments all around us covered in lots of moss, buddha statues, little paths left and right and a main path leading 1,5 km ahead, to the mausoleum. We got impressed by the architecture of the mausoleum / temple. We expected all japanese temples to look pretty much the same, but even though they are similar, each is quite unique.

We returned to the monks, just in time for dinner, around 17:30.
We did not expect much, but the dinner has us quite full and satisfied in the end. The monks do not eat meat or fish, neither do they eat onion and garlic, which are believed to give them too much energy and make them prone to temptation.
Alcohol is not prohibited, however. Simply renamed. Sake to "wisdom water" and beer to "bubbly wisdom water". We ordered 2 wisdom waters.
The monastery is cold, wearing our yukatas and more in attempts to stay warm. Kostas was not brave enough to submerge himself in the onsen, just the feet. Faye on the other hand, went all in, but came out with nausea from the heat. She probably stayed too long.

Afterwards, chilled in the room and looked from our window to the zen garden (pebbles, stones and moss, arranged in a somewhat asymmetrical way, pebbles imitating water ripples around the moss-covered stones). We think that so far staying at an onsen and a Buddhist temple are the best ways to really experience the Japanese culture.
(You have to take off your shoes, you wear a yukata, you sleep on futons, you bathe the old way, you eat traditionally prepared food, you live by the rules of the host)

Another surprising thing: we have mostly seen Japanese people in these tradinional inns, which is nice to see.

Sleepy timer now, time to join the 06:30 prayers of the monks tomorrow. üìøüôèüèº
