Woke up after a surprisingly good sleep on a futon.
We got a delicous breakfast at the onsen, multiple dishes. Then we got a shuttle ride to the station, courtesy of the hotel.

We left Yudanaka by train to Matsumoto.
Had an in-between stop at Nagano, so we quickly bought some apples (the best in the world). We tried them: beautifully red, huge, crunchy, juicy, delicious üçé‚ú®

Visited matsumoto castle (the black crow). Interesting architecture, indoors with steep narrow stairs, great view from it of Japanese alps with snowy peaks. The garden around it full of maple trees turning orange and red and gengko trees turning light green and golden.

As we were taking a selfie we met Steve, an artist from Miami learning the trade of woodblock carving in japan. He took some photos of us with the castle. We returned the favor. We talked, he showed us some of his art. Was good.

Afterwards, we took  the train to Nakatsugawa, where we'd stay the night, close to the trail we will walk the next day.
