After a long (long) sleep, Kostas woke up without fever. So we went on the rooftop of our hotel to take in the view first, and some fresh air.
Then, we decided to go to Yanesen district, a more laid-back area, and as we saw for the first time, with more low and small buildings. Almost at every corner, a small, cute shrine.

We came upon an antique market, with stalls selling Japanese items, from jewelry to unique (and rare?) figureheads, to handmade wood, metal, glass work, clocks, rings, masks...

Went to the "cat" street, with a lot of cat-themed shops. One of the shops wrote "no cat no life". Faye could not resist and bought a cat souvenir üêà
Kostas got really excited when he spotted a food stand selling (big) fried shrimp. We bought 2. It was yummy üç§

We walked around the area and at last were in the Yanaken cemetery. A serene place with many trees. We were surprized to see a child on a swing in a playground inside the cemetery. 

Then were 'kapoetskie' (exhausted/destroyed - Faye's made up word). Faye also started to feel sick, and Kostas got his fever back. Returned to the hotel , put on our cozy and soft pyjamas (every hotel provided one so far, amazing!) and took an extremely long rest to hopefully get rid of the illness.
